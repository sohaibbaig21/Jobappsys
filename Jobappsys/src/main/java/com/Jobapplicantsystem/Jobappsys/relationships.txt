Purpose: Stores applicant's answers to job-specific questions
Relationships:

MANY-TO-ONE with Job_Applications (many answers belong to one application)

Relationships:

MANY-TO-ONE with Job_Posts (one job can be shared multiple times)
MANY-TO-ONE with Users (one user can share multiple jobs)


Java Concept: EVENT TRACKING - Logs user actions for analytics


14. JOB_REPORTS

Purpose: Allows users to report inappropriate job postings
Relationships:

MANY-TO-ONE with Job_Posts (one job can be reported multiple times)
MANY-TO-ONE with Users (one user can report multiple jobs)


Java Concept: MODERATION PATTERN - Common pattern for content reporting
State Pattern: Uses status field (PENDING, UNDER_REVIEW, RESOLVED, DISMISSED)


15. APPLICATION_STATUS_HISTORY (Audit Trail)

Purpose: Maintains complete history of all application status changes
Relationships:

MANY-TO-ONE with Job_Applications (one application has many status changes)
MANY-TO-ONE with Users (tracks who changed the status)


Java Concept: AUDIT TRAIL / TEMPORAL DATA - Maintains historical records
Pattern: HISTORY PATTERN - Never updated, only inserted (append-only)


16. NOTIFICATIONS

Purpose: System notifications for users about relevant events
Relationships:

MANY-TO-ONE with Users (one user has many notifications)
Soft reference to other entities via reference_id and reference_type


Java Concept: OBSERVER PATTERN - Notifies users of system events
Polymorphic Reference: reference_id can point to different entity types

Key Java/OOP Concepts Demonstrated

Inheritance: Users → Applicants/Employers
Composition: Job_Posts → Job_Questions (strong ownership)
Aggregation: Job_Applications (weak ownership)
Polymorphism: User types (APPLICANT vs EMPLOYER)
Encapsulation: Data hiding through proper relationships
Association: Various linking tables
State Pattern: Application and Job statuses
Observer Pattern: Notifications system
Strategy Pattern: Different job types and work modes
Audit Trail: Status history tracking


Cardinality Constraints

UNIQUE constraints ensure data integrity (e.g., one user can only apply once to a job)
CASCADE DELETE maintains referential integrity
CHECK constraints enforce valid enum values
NOT NULL constraints ensure required data
Foreign Keys maintain relationships


Design Patterns Applied

Soft Delete Pattern: Using is_active flags instead of hard deletes
Audit Trail Pattern: Status history tables
Temporal Data Pattern: Tracking changes over time
Polymorphic Association: Notifications can reference different entity types
Event Sourcing: Tracking user actions (shares, saves, reports)
Lookup Table Pattern: Skills as a central reference
